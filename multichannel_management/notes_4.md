## Misc. issues
- attribution theory
- - explaining behaviour
- - external: the cause of your behaviour is external (preferred when negative)
- - internal: the cause is within (preferred when positive)
- social information processing theory
- - we take social cues into account when deciding what to do
- - e.g. someone looking puzzled -> more explanation
- SIM being neither idiosyncratic nor random (???)
- conflict resolution and negotiation by email explained by SIM (???)
- horizontal and vertical views on politics (???)
