- To me this goes very much in the direction of worker surveilance. Did the authors ever comment on possible ethical issues?
- How reliable are self-reported interruption severities? Shouldn't it be measured rather by the task performance?
- Shouldn't the ML task be treated rather as a regression instead of classification?
- Why did the authors not explore more complex models? Logistic regression allows for almost the same degree of explainability but with higher performance (usually).

answered:
- How is accuracy measured? Where do the true labels come from?

- Couldn't the positive results be caused by the fact that the presence of the lightbulb just increased awareness of interruptions which made co-workers more careful? This is supported by the lower number of interruptions overall after installation in Figure 4.
- If yes, then shouldn't the logs be collected also once the lighbulbs are removed or at least contrasted with a group that used something else to raise awareness, like a post saying "every interruption bears hidden costs"?
